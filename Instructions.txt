Extraction:
	For the extraction notebook to work all the audio file should be in a folder name "speech_files" and in "wav" format
	It will run smoothely as long as this folder is in the directory
	Extraction, goes through each sound file and extract the 6 features using ParselMouth. 
	The features are then converted in to pandas dataframe and then plotted for ease of use
	The first plot is regule then the Neutral normalized and lastl the Z-Score normalised


Classification:
	For this notebookto run, the location of the openSmile binary should be specifiec in the third code cell along with the directy reltive to current for the audio files
	The config file to be used and its also has to be specified
	If all the directory an files are correctly specified in the thrid code cell the code will run smoothely
	The code first call openSMILE to get features for each file
	It then append thes name of the files and stires the csv
	Then it reads the stored csv and then seperates by user and performs machine learning first on regular and then on normalised data
